class DALIAudioClassificationIterator(DALIGenericIterator):
    """
    DALI iterator for classification tasks for PyTorch. It returns 3 outputs
    (data, label and rate) in the form of PyTorch's Tensor.

    Calling

    .. code-block:: python

       DALIClassificationIterator(pipelines, size)

    is equivalent to calling

    .. code-block:: python

       DALIGenericIterator(pipelines, ["data", "label"], size)

    Please keep in mind that Tensors returned by the iterator are
    still owned by DALI. They are valid till the next iterator call.
    If the content needs to be preserved please copy it to another tensor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pipelines : list of nvidia.dali.pipeline.Pipeline
                List of pipelines to use
    size : int
           Number of samples in the epoch (Usually the size of the dataset).
           Providing -1 means that the iterator will work until StopIteration is raised
           from the inside of iter_setup(). The options `fill_last_batch`, `last_batch_padded` and
           `auto_reset` don't work in such case. It works with only one pipeline inside
           the iterator.
    auto_reset : bool, optional, default = False
                 Whether the iterator resets itself for the next epoch
                 or it requires reset() to be called separately.
    fill_last_batch : bool, optional, default = True
                 Whether to fill the last batch with data up to 'self.batch_size'.
                 The iterator would return the first integer multiple
                 of self._num_gpus * self.batch_size entries which exceeds 'size'.
                 Setting this flag to False will cause the iterator to return
                 exactly 'size' entries.
    dynamic_shape: bool, optional, default = False
                 Whether the shape of the output of the DALI pipeline can
                 change during execution. If True, the pytorch tensor will be resized accordingly
                 if the shape of DALI returned tensors changes during execution.
                 If False, the iterator will fail in case of change.
    last_batch_padded : bool, optional, default = False
                 Whether the last batch provided by DALI is padded with the last sample
                 or it just wraps up. In the conjunction with `fill_last_batch` it tells
                 if the iterator returning last batch with data only partially filled with
                 data from the current epoch is dropping padding samples or samples from
                 the next epoch. If set to False next epoch will end sooner as data from
                 it was consumed but dropped. If set to True next epoch would be the
                 same length as the first one.

    Example
    -------
    With the data set ``[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`` and the batch size 2:

    fill_last_batch = False, last_batch_padded = True  -> last batch = ``[7]``, next iteration will return ``[1, 2]``

    fill_last_batch = False, last_batch_padded = False -> last batch = ``[7]``, next iteration will return ``[2, 3]``

    fill_last_batch = True, last_batch_padded = True   -> last batch = ``[7, 7]``, next iteration will return ``[1, 2]``

    fill_last_batch = True, last_batch_padded = False  -> last batch = ``[7, 1]``, next iteration will return ``[2, 3]``
